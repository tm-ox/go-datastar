# go-datastar

A learning project exploring Go, [Datastar](https://data-star.dev), [templ](https://templ.guide), and Tailwind v4.

## Stack

- **Go 1.26** — `net/http` stdlib router, no framework
- **templ** — type-safe HTML templates compiled to Go
- **Datastar v1.0.1** — SSE-based reactivity (server-driven UI)
- **Tailwind v4** — CSS-first, no config file
- **SQLite** — `modernc.org/sqlite`, pure Go, no CGo

## Prerequisites

```bash
go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Setup

```bash
bun install
templ generate
bun run build:css
```

## Seed

Populate the database. Run each command once after first startup — safe to re-run, uses `INSERT OR IGNORE`.

```bash
go run ./cmd/seed/products/
go run ./cmd/seed/work/
go run ./cmd/seed/work_images/
go run ./cmd/seed/content/
```

> Must be run in order — `work_images` depends on work IDs existing.

## Dev

```bash
make dev
```

Runs four processes concurrently: Go server (`:8081`), templ watcher, Tailwind watcher, browser-sync proxy (`:3000`).

| Layer | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Go server | 8081 | App |
| browser-sync | 3000 | CSS injection without full reload |

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

If air serves a stale binary after changes: `rm tmp/server && make dev`.
