# go-datastar

A learning project exploring Go, [Datastar](https://data-star.dev), [templ](https://templ.guide), and Tailwind v4.

## Stack

- **Go 1.26** — `net/http` stdlib router, no framework
- **templ** — type-safe HTML templates compiled to Go
- **Datastar v1.0.1** — SSE-based reactivity (server-driven UI)
- **Tailwind v4** — CSS-first, no config file
- **SQLite** — `modernc.org/sqlite`, pure Go, no CGo

## Prerequisites

```bash
go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Setup

```bash
bun install
templ generate
bun run build:css
```

## Seed

Populate the database. Run each command once after first startup — safe to re-run, uses `INSERT OR IGNORE`.

```bash
go run ./cmd/seed/products/
go run ./cmd/seed/work/
go run ./cmd/seed/work_images/
go run ./cmd/seed/content/
```

> Must be run in order — `work_images` depends on work IDs existing.

## Dev

```bash
make dev
```

Runs four processes concurrently: Go server (`:8081`), templ watcher, Tailwind watcher, browser-sync proxy (`:3000`).

| Layer | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Go server | 8081 | App |
| browser-sync | 3000 | CSS injection without full reload |

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

If air serves a stale binary after changes: `rm tmp/server && make dev`.

## Architecture notes

- **Stores are concrete, not interfaces.** Each store is a struct over `*sql.DB`;
  swapping the backend means rewriting `internal/store`, not the callers. Tested
  against in-memory SQLite. See `docs/adr/0001`.
- **`render.Page` owns the page shell.** Handlers pass a `*Content` partial plus
  nav/path/meta; `render.Page` decides between a full `BaseLayout` render and a
  Datastar SSE shell-patch (`site-header` + `main`). Domain vocabulary lives in
  `CONTEXT.md`.
- **The Dashboard pushes, it doesn't pull.** `internal/stream` is a realtime
  pipeline: one `Source` holds a single upstream connection to
  `stream.wikimedia.org`, fans every `Event` out through an in-memory `Hub` to
  many browser SSE subscribers (bounded buffer, drop-on-full so one slow client
  can't stall the rest), and feeds an `Aggregator` of rolling stats read via
  `Snapshot`. `/dashboard/stream` holds a long-lived SSE connection — opened by
  `data-init` and torn down by `requestCancellation: 'cleanup'` on SPA
  navigate-away — patching a live feed per event and the tiles/charts on a 1s
  ticker. Everything is in-memory; state resets on restart, nothing is stored.

## Test

```bash
go test ./...
```

Store, render, and db tests run against a throwaway in-memory SQLite database — no
fixtures, no external services.

## SQLite Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `products` | Shop products |
| `work` | Work portfolio entries |
| `work_images` | Work entry images (FK → work.id) |
| `site_pages` | Page-level copy (title, tagline, body) |
| `site_sections` | Page sections |
| `site_cards` | Section cards |
